My roommate Yayun has been learning the piano since she was really young. She has graciously allowed me to place my amateur fingers on her piano. I'm starting off with the Alfred's Adult Piano books and then moving on to pieces that I like. Hoping to use this page as a place to document my progress and also as motivation to keep learning. If for some godforsaken reason you decide to listen to these, please forgive me for the horrible audio. I'm using the mediocre microphone on my phone.
