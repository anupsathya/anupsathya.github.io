A recent obsession with Formula 1 and a childhood obsession with rally racing recently led to a haphazard construction of a racing sim. My roommate [Zeyu](https://www.zeyuyan.com) and I drove 4 hours to Virginia to grab this wheel and pedal set that this guy was selling on Facebook Marketplace. He threw in an F1 wheel because we made a long drive. 

After grabbing the wheel, we salvaged some old 2x4's, some scrap wood from 2 different makerspaces at UMD, a couple of extra bolts from our powerlifting rack, a seat from Zeyu's friend's Miata and we put it to together to build this rig. It runs on Zeyu's new fancy gaming PC and we decided to use the monitor on his desk that swivels across. 

Monza, here we come.
