A couple of centuries into the future, humans are an interplanetary species. Space is no longer unexplored territory, but an everyday playground. Unfortunately, we haven’t been careful. Everyday, millions of people die by hitting space trash at light speeds. The enterprise needs to act quick. The best way to make this smoother is to pit people against each other and make them clean up space for all the riches in the world. 
You’re a new recruit on a space trash collector. You were hoping to get a better job than this but unfortunately, you’re destined to take down meeting minutes for now. BUT there’s been a horrible accident. A large meteor took out the trash collector net. The space engineers have managed to connect your keyboard to the space laser. The future of the universe lies in your typing skills.
