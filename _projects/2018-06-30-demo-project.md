DopeScope is an attempt at delivering an inexpensive, un-intimidating scope for Universities in India with poor scientific infrastructure.

An [employability report](https://www.aspiringminds.com/sites/default/files/National%20Employability%20Report%20-%20Engineers%20Annual%20Report%202016.pdf) conducted in India, concluded that 80% of all engineers in India are unemployable. These numbers were much lower for the Universities that were ranked outside the top 100. After asking a couple of students in Electrical and Electronics Engineering, about why they felt like they lacked practical skills, the most common answer we got was something like this,

> "We don't feel comfortable using equipment in the lab as it's too expensive. We're often restricted by lab assistants and professors from truly experimenting. "

Although scopes are very robust, we couldn't go around convincing students that it's actually hard to break one, so we decided to make a cheap one. We also added a smattering of other features to make things interesting for hobbyists.
